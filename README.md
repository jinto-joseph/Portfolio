1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jinto-joseph/Portfolio.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash 
   cd Portfolio
3. **Open the Website**:
   
     ***Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
     Alternatively, use a local server for better performance***
```bash
  # If you have Python installed
  python -m http.server 8000
```
  Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

  Note: Ensure you have an internet connection, as the website uses external CDNs for Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts.
